Peppermint Terminal Theme
=========================
I originally found the theme (here)[http://noahfrederick.com/blog/2011/lion-terminal-theme-peppermint/ 'Pepperming theme'].  
You will need to import it through the Terminal options interface.

Vim configuration
=================
I have set most of this up already through the use of Vundle.  
To install all dependencies to run Vim, follow the following easy commands:
1. `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`
2. `git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim ~/.vim/bundle/vundle`
3. `vim +BundleInstall +qall`
